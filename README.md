# 🍺 Mabuuk is AI Drunk Transfer Protection

> **Don't let drunk-you ruin sober-you's portfolio.**

Mabuuk is an AI-powered sobriety verification layer for crypto transfers, built on [GenLayer Bradbury Testnet](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com). When you attempt a high-value transaction, the contract automatically generates a logical riddle and uses AI validators to analyze your answer. If you sound drunk, panicked, or impaired — the transaction gets blocked and your wallet is locked for 4 hours.

No more waking up to regret.

## 🔴 The Problem

Crypto transactions are irreversible. One drunk transfer, one panic sell at 3 AM, and your portfolio takes a hit you can't undo. Traditional wallets have zero protection against impaired decision-making — there's no *"Are you sure you're sober?"* button.

## 🟢 The Solution

Mabuuk acts as an AI bodyguard for your wallet:

1. You initiate a transfer with destination and amount
2. Amount below 500 tokens? → approved instantly, no checks needed
3. Amount ≥ 500 tokens? → AI automatically generates a riddle on-chain
4. You answer the riddle → AI validators analyze your response
5. ✅ **PASS** → transfer approved, you're verified sober
6. ❌ **FAIL** → transfer blocked, wallet locked for 4 hours, funds saved

The AI doesn't just check if the answer is correct — it analyzes whether the response shows signs of drunk typing, gibberish, panic, or incoherent reasoning.

### Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧩 AI Riddle Generation | Automatically triggered during high-value transfers via `gl.nondet.exec_prompt()` |
| 🧠 Sobriety Verification | AI detects drunk typing, gibberish, and panic behavior |
| 🔒 Auto-Lock | Failed verification locks the wallet for 4 hours |
| 📊 Per-Wallet Stats | Tracks attempts, passes, rejections, and funds saved |
| ⚡ Risk Threshold | Low-value transfers (< 500 tokens) bypass AI checks instantly |
| 🔤 Address Normalization | All addresses stored lowercase to prevent mismatch bugs |
| 📝 Pending Transfer State | High-risk transfers stored as pending until riddle is answered |

### Contract Methods

| Method | Type | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| `execute_transfer()` | write | `destination`, `amount`, `current_time` | Attempt transfer — low-risk auto-approves, high-risk generates riddle |
| `answer_riddle()` | write | `user_answer`, `current_time` | Submit riddle answer for AI sobriety verification |
| `get_pending_riddle()` | view | `user_address` | Get the active riddle for a pending transfer |
| `get_last_riddle()` | view | — | Retrieve the most recently generated riddle |
| `get_user_profile()` | view | `user_address` | Get wallet stats (attempts, passes, rejections, funds saved) |
| `check_lock_status()` | view | `user_address`, `current_time` | Check if wallet is currently locked |
| `get_risk_threshold()` | view | — | Get current risk threshold value |
| `get_error()` | view | — | Get last operation status message |

## 🔗 GenLayer Integration

### Optimistic Democracy Consensus

Mabuuk uses `gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe(leader_fn, validator_fn)` for both riddle generation and sobriety verification:

- **Leader node** — generates the result (riddle text or PASS/FAIL decision)
- **Validator nodes** — independently verify the leader's output

### Equivalence Principle

**Pattern: Partial Field Matching** — validators compare only the final `PASS`/`FAIL` status (not the full LLM reasoning), ensuring consensus on the binary outcome while allowing variation in analysis.

### GenLayer Patterns Used

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `gl.nondet.exec_prompt()` | Free-text LLM outputs (riddle generation) |
| Binary PASS/FAIL extraction | Strict consensus matching |
| `TreeMap[str, ...]` | Per-wallet persistent storage (stats, locks, pending transfers) |
| `.lower()` normalization | Consistent address key mapping |
| Pending state pattern | `pending_dest`, `pending_amt`, `pending_riddle` per user |

## 💡 Why "Mabuuk"?

**Mabuuk** (مابوك / mabuk) means **"drunk"** in Indonesian. The name captures exactly what this project protects you from — yourself, when you've had a few too many.
